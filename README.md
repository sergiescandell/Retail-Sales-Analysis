# Retail Sales Analysis
This project analyzes nearly 100,000 transactions recorded across multiple shopping centers from 2021 to 2023. As analysts for the holding company that owns these centers, our goal is to extract valuable insights from sales data to drive strategic decision-making.

To achieve this, we conduct a data-driven analysis that addresses key business questions, uncovering trends in consumer behavior, seasonal patterns, and sales performance.
